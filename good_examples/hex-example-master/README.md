# Gira (A Hex Example)

This is a sample project that was originally supposed to be and example of [hexagonal architecture](http://www.joeldholmes.com/post/go-hex-arch/). It has slowly evolved to incorporate other ideas and product integrations. 

Gira is a _really_ simple ticket management API. You can create and fetch ticket (that's it). The application is flexible in that it can run as either a AWS Lambda function or a standalong server. It also allows you to swap backend database (between Redis or Postgres). 

This project will continue to evolve and change depending on things I'm interested in learning.
